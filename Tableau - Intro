Tableau Types:

Tableau public :  It's free..Hurray!!! That being said, most of the data that we work on is in cloud and its public. So 
Anyone can view and download our work. Files cannot be saved locally

Tableau Desktop: It's not free.. very strong security for data. Full version of Tableau. Can get data srcs from our own data warehouse/DB.
Eg: Data srcs can be SQL server, Oracle services etc.. from any data src

Tableau Server: Its the more poweful of all. But can be used only by eople who has server dedicated to tableau. very expensive..can be
acquired by an org. very much capable of doing anything. More viewing control of data even if its on public, more security of data adn prevnt
people from downloading any data sets.

Tableau Online: Stores viz on cloud. Can only share with people who have Tableau license.
